- Credential dumping (SAM & SYSTEM)
- Remote tool persistence (AnyDesk)
- Lateral movement via RDP
- Scheduled task persistence
- Sensitive payroll data access
- Anti-forensics and reflective memory loading

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

The intrusion began with execution of a malicious double-extension file:

Daniel_Richardson_CV.pdf.exe

Execution chain:

explorer.exe
└── Daniel_Richardson_CV.pdf.exe
└── notepad.exe “”

The payload:

- Established C2 communication to `cdn.cloud-endpoint.net`
- Retrieved additional payloads from `sync.cloud-endpoint.net`
- Dumped `SAM` and `SYSTEM` registry hives
- Staged credentials in `C:\Users\Public`
- Installed AnyDesk for persistent remote access
- Attempted lateral movement via `psexec.exe` and `wmic.exe`
- Successfully pivoted using `mstsc.exe`
- Enabled a disabled account using `/active:yes`
- Created scheduled task `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateCheck`
- Renamed payload to `RuntimeBroker.exe`
- Created backdoor account `svc_backup`
- Accessed payroll document `BACS_Payments_Dec2025.ods`
- Archived data into `Shares.7z`
- Cleared Security and System logs
- Loaded SharpChrome reflectively into `notepad.exe`

## 🔎 Detection Rules

This investigation produced Defender-ready detection patterns:

1. Double-extension executable detection (`*.pdf.exe`)
2. Registry hive dumping via `reg save`
3. certutil.exe external downloads
4. AnyDesk installation monitoring
5. Scheduled task creation via `schtasks.exe`
6. RDP pivot correlation
7. Suspicious archive creation (`.7z`)
8. Event log clearing detection
9. ClrUnbackedModuleLoaded monitoring

All KQL queries are stored in the `/queries/` directory.
